Data used:
The data I used to test my program were only the original values used within the CONFIG.txt file.

Lessons learned:
I learned many lessons during this project. Primarily I need to break down the code into small
sections and not to try to tackle too many items at once. Also to stay focused on the big picture
of the process and ensure nothing gets left behind.
