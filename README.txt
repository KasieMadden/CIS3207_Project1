Giorgio Discrete Event Simulator: written in C++.


This programâ€™s objective is to understand a simplified computing system.The event simulator will execute randomly
generated events in turn using randomly allowance of time. These events will arrive at the CPU (if the CUP is busy it will
wait in the FIFO queue until the CPU is ready),it then lingers in the CPU until the event is completed or it will move
forward to Disk 1, Disk 2 or Network and will continue this cycle until the job is  compete.
